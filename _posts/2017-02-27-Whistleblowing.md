I spent last summer (2016) in Washington D.C. working for the consulting company Booz Allen Hamilton. Before that point, I thought, what with the Internet, 24-hour news cycle, and all that, that I was pretty well immersed in the goings-on and machinations of our government. But being physically there, living as a **resident** of the capital city, made that immersion take on a whole new meaning. <!-- MORE -->My employer's biggest client was, and continues to be, the Department of Defense. The White House, Office of Personnel Management, and International Monetary Fund were features of my morning commute. I had a job interview at a federal agency. All this is to say that I'm fascinated with the machinations of our government, and hope to one day participate.

That's why the issue of whistleblowing is of distinct personal interest to me.

At its core, whistleblowing, like many other aspects of our democracy, is about **government accountability**. But unlike checks and balances, term limits, and the like, whistleblowing is particularly complex for being extra-legal, aimed often at bringing down unjust laws or corrupt officials. These truly are noble motivations, but it would be unfair to represent them as the only motivations people have for whistleblowing. I've looked, and there isn't a whole lot of data here, but it isn't hard to imagine fame or ego driving the decision to leak.

So with that vague and probably obvious intro to whistleblowing, I want to dig into this book I read last year called *This Machine Kills Secrets*, by Andy Greenberg. This one was a fun one to read in D.C. since occasionally the story would find its way into the city (or even mention my employer). The book is a fascinating tapestry of true narratives, interviews (including more than one with Julian Assange himself), and research covering cryptography, the hacker underground, Icelandic poetry, and yes, whistleblowing. Greenberg analyzes the cases of Daniel Ellsburg and Bradley Manning (who, at the time of the book's publication, was still in prison) to illustrate technology's impact on the evolution of leaking.

> When Dr. Daniel Ellsberg decided to violate thirteen years' worth of security clearances, embark on the largest public breach of top security documents in the twentieth century, and likely spend the rest of hist life in prison, he faced a problem: how to duplicate seven thousand pieces of paper many times over using 1969 technology.
> ...
> Over the next year, Ellsberg would spend countless nights hauling... papers out of the building in an inconspicuous briefcase, then standing in front of that primitive copier in a dark office reproducing a secret history of America's involvement in Vietnam: the Pentagon Papers.
> -- Andy Greenberg, This Machine Kills Secrets

Compare this to the mere hours, possibly even minutes, it takes to upload files to WikiLeaks. This was the process Bradley Manning used when he uploaded hundreds of thousands of files (over 241,000 diplomatic wires alone) to WikiLeaks, likely from his aunt's home in Maryland.

So the question naturally arises: are these Americans **traitors** or **heroes**?

I think Ben Wizner, directory of the Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project at the ACLU, put it well:

When a soldier who shared information with the press and public is punished far more harshly than others who tortured prisoners and killed civilians, something is seriously wrong with our justice system.
-- Ben Wizner, ACLU

He's not answering directly the question around these two individual whistleblowers, but he is summarizing one of the primary concerns of those who would put themselves in the "hero" camp. I heard it argued in class that Manning's leaks did not promote public safety or meet any requirements for whistleblower protection. But I also heard it argued that the leaked documents (in both cases) were evidence of the government acting in ways contradictory to American values, in ways that were, at best, an embarrassment to the American people (possibly the most clear modern example of this was the [helicopter combat footage](https://www.wired.com/2010/04/whistleblower-report-leaked-video-shows-us-coverup/) released by Manning).

I in no way mean to downplay or rationalize the irresponsibility enabled by wholesale digital leakage. Secrets exist for a reason, and will never cease to do so. And spreading those secrets (or perhaps more importantly, violating the trust vested in you by your government, and by extension, fellow citizens) cannot be taken lightly. I'm not remotely convinced that the documents Manning leaked were carefully curated to maximize systemic change in the military, which I think was wrong. That being said, I do still stand by Wizner and am glad that Obama commuted Chelsea Manning's sentence. Paul Ryan has denounced the act, saying that it sets a "dangerous precedent" (Friedersdorf).

I think **he's right**.

This commutation is a dangerous precedent for organizations and individuals who would abuse our government's classification system to act immorally or in any way misaligned with American values.
