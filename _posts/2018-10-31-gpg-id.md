I've finally gotten around to properly reading up on [GnuPG<i class="fa
fa-external-link"></i>][gpg]{:target="_blank"}, using keys, and managing a
trusted public identity. I've dabbled in the past, and this dabbling has
resulted in a couple of keys with my name on them being published.

The TL;DR of this post is: my **real** GPG public key ID is [`FFB2398B`<i
class="fa fa-external-link"></i>][key]{:target="_blank"}.

[gpg]: https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html
[key]: http://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xC0BFCABCFFB2398B

Now that I'm closer to knowing what I'm doing, I'm going to try and consolidate
my identity; I'm actively searching for the old keys so I can generate
revocation certificates for them.

This is the fingerprint of the key I'm sticking with:
