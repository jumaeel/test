Welcome back to the Coffee Log. I've had a couple skips in the last few days.
Yesterday, for instance, there was no post because I didn't make coffee in the
morning (yes, that's the first time since starting the Log that this has
happened). Although, I still had a cup a little later from the machine at work,
so I suppose I could have written about that.

This morning's brew (I'm coming to you with a retrospective today; it's about
8PM at the moment) was not hugely different from Monday's. I used a little less
coffee (3 Tbsp), but the impact wasn't huge. We saw coffee at 3:29" and had a
full chamber at 3:42". I tell you, this light roast fills up the chamber fast
once it starts going.

## Review

Like I mentioned, the feature's of today's joe were not intensely different
from Monday's. As you might have come to suspect, it was simply a milder
version. This includes of course the aroma and those zingy high notes of the
flavor I've described before. Perhaps it's a marginal move in the right
direction, but as you can here, my judgement isn't exactly dripping with
confidence.

## Thoughts for Tomorrow

Let's keep this thread going; I'll take off another teaspoon from the brew,
putting me at 2 and 2/3 Tbsp.
