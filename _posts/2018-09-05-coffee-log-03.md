As planned, today I tried brewing with the lid closed and slightly fewer
grounds in the filter. I was trying to isolate the factor responsible for
yesterday's more mild brew.

Today, it took 8:18" for the joe to start pouring out from the sprout, and
about 20 seconds to fill the top chamber.

## Review

I have to say I can't quite put my finger on the flavor of this cup. I can only
vaguely place it between [day 1][day1] and [day 2's][day2] brews in terms of
bitterness. The aroma was similar to yesterday's, but slightly stronger.
Wherever it is this cups lies on the bitterness spectrum, I think it's crossed
just over the line of what I like, so I'm going to give it a **5.9**/10.

The amount of grounds at the bottom of my mug this morning was perhaps the main
redeeming quality of this brew -- I found very few grounds sneaking into my
last sip, perhaps even fewer than in yesterday's cup.

## Thoughts for Tomorrow

To complete my bitterness grid search, tomorrow I'll brew my cup with a full
filter compartment and an open lid. Hopefully I'll be able to keep the heat
consistent, but as yesterday showed, I may need to bump it from 4 to 6 at the
end of the process to *encourage* the coffee up through the spout.
