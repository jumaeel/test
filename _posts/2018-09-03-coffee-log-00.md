## Introduction to the Coffee Log series

When I moved out here to Washington, my mom sent me on my way with a [Bialetti

espresso maker. It's an interesting little device -- like a tall, two-chambered
tea kettle -- whose original design is over 80 years old.

In an attempt to hone my coffee craft, I'll be documenting the details of my
morning brew, most, if not all mornings. I hope to converge towards the most
perfect cup. Maybe this can also serve as a resource (or maybe a warning,
depending on how things go) for you fellow Moka Express people out there, who
knows!
