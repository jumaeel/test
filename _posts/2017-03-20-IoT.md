Comparing the Wild West to the Internet is probably a pretty tired metaphor at this point, but I couldn't help but think about it as I read through pages of material on security in Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

This impression was particularly strong while reading a [Hackaday article]() on the subject which likened "unpatched IoT appliances" to "(pre-service-pack-two) Windows XP machines" (which made me smile since XP SP1 VMs were my go-to targets back when I first learned that Kali Linux was a thing). I think that's because this new frontier, if receding, is still largely **unexplored** and thusly **unregulated**.

<!-- MORE -->

The knee-jerk reaction from my inner libertarian is "yes! regulation is the enemy!" However, a few moments of critical thinking illuminate the flaws in this thinking.

## Can we leave it to the market?

Echoing a good portion of the assigned reading, I contend that the market has not demanded a standard of security sufficient to balance safety and privacy with the innate risks of Internet usage. In other words:

> The market can't fix this because neither the buyer nor the seller cares.
> -- Bruce Schneier, Motherboard

I'm sure that in many cases, apathy among producers and consumers is benign, but this is not one such case. Wiring up thousands or even millions of insecure IoT devices (which, in plain terms, are still just computers) puts everyone and everything online at risk, as was demonstrated by the recent attack on Dyn, the DNS provider. The recklessness in the security practices (or lack thereof) of so many IoT device manufacturers is demonstrably dangerous.

So to whom can we turn when the market fails to correct corporate irresponsibility?

## What about the government?

Relying on the government to step in to private markets, particularly those with digital goods, can be a tricky path since you risk government overreach and a market that outpaces regulation (the latter situation is especially dangerous to innovation). However, I for one have been made at least a little optimistic by the FCC's progress in net neutrality under the Obama administration (let's see if that keeps up).

Hopeful though we may be, the second scenario mentioned just above can be all to real, as Amy Nordrum mentions in an IEEE Spectrum post:

> However, Lee at ESET North America said government regulation is difficult to apply to cybersecurity. By the time regulations are in place, new threats and solutions have inevitably popped up.
> -- Amy Nordrum, IEEE Spectrum

Maybe the trick isn't to rely on regulation, but to supplement a more robust solution with it.

I'm reminded of the Society of Automotive Engineers' (SAE) *five levels* of autonomous vehicles and how that framework guides (or at least could guide) policy. Perhaps the cybersecurity industry could use a similar framework which in broad terms classifies IoT devices and helps lawmakers apply those classifications in policy.

A common theme throughout these discussions has been **trust**. Do we trust device manufacturers to provide secure devices? Do we trust our government to watch out for us? Do we trust ourselves to be responsible for our data and Internet enabled devices?

As far as trusting manufacturers go, I absolutely do not. I try, in general, not to use such sweeping generalizations as "I don't trust *any* IoT manufacturer" but in this case, a *guilty until proven innocent* approach is much safer than the converse. Plus, I think it would make a really fun **side project** to make a DIY smart home or entertainment system.

In short, what we stand to gain from buying insecure IoT products is nothing in light of the risks we accept with them. I've said it before and I'll say it again: you vote with your wallet. And I for one will be casting my vote *against* an insecure Internet of Things.
