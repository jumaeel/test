The culmination of our unit on hiring and diversity was a report on the hiring process for Notre Dame computer science undergrads. I coordinated with Dan Currie on this project.

I think the most important of our guide is the section on hackathons. *Cracking the Coding Interview* and practice interviews get a lot of coverage in class, but hackathons, not so much. I can scarcely remember the last time one was mentioned in a CS class. And yet, they're one of the best ways to prep for the hiring process. This past Fall, nearly all of my interviewers asked about my IrishHACKS 2015 project ([*Tempo*](https://github.com/wbadart/tempo)). Aside from things to talk about, hackathons give you hands-on experience building real-world products.

I don't think the existing curriculum and interview-prep activities are distinct enough to warrant significant change to the CS program. Moving data structures back a semester was probably the best thing the department could have done to help kids prep for tech interviews.
