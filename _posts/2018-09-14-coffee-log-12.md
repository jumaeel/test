Today's cup was brought to you by 4 tablespoons of Trader Joe's Arabica medium
roast coffee grounds. Let's get right to it. Time to brew was 4:24" and total
time to completion was 5:04".

## Review

The brew this morning tasting practically identical to yesterday's, supporting
my suspicion that 1-tspn increments aren't enough for a discernible effect on
flavor. That being said, it was still a tasty cup of coffee that share all the
desirable traits of yesterday's. **7.2**/10.

## Thoughts for Tomorrow

I suppose I can go one more step in filling up the filter and go for ~4.5 Tbsp,
but I'm not convinced that that's not overkill at this point. And, as I
mentioned yesterday, I'm running low on Arabica and will probably pick a new
roast once it's out.
