This is by far the latest I've every written a coffee log entry. Hopefully the
latest I'll ever go. When I woke up, I really wasn't feeling like rigorous
experimenting, so I poured in grounds until I had about 3/4 centimeters
clearance from the top of the filter.

And I'll be damned, it was delicious.

## Review

This mystery cup brought me back to my first breakthrough from [day 6][day 6],
the one that really made me excited about this project. Everything I said in
that post applies today. **8**/10.

In the spirit of non-rigor described above, I did fail to time the brew.

## Thoughts for Tomorrow

Since I didn't get it done today, tomorrow I'm going to go through with the
plan I proposed yesterday: make a brew with 4.7 Tbsp of grounds.

I also picked out my next bag of grounds today: it's the same bean, T Joe's
Arabica, but in the light roast variety (unfortunately, I couldn't find it
online anywhere; Amazon only carries the medium and dark roasts).
