Today's experiment was pretty casual. I used 4 round-ish tablespoons of grounds
and set the burner to *6* (this was today's independent variable). All in all,
I had pretty unremarkable results, although, the brew time was nice and quick,
taking just 3:13" to start dripping, and 3:41" to complete. I also didn't have
to deal with the high-energy explosions the low-grounds brews seem to cause.

## Review

At this point, I'm mostly just biding my time until the medium roast runs out,
so I'm not disappointed in how this cup turned out. Maybe 6 is too hot. Not
sure. All I can say is that the main word that comes to mind describing my
coffee this morning was "unimpressive" (though not exceptionally awful).
**6**/10.

## Thoughts for Tomorrow

I should have just enough medium roast left to try things out at burner setting
7 (which I suspect is going to be a bit much). Nonetheless, we'll give it a
shot, and as always, see what happens.
