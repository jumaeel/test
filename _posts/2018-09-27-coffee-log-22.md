Good Thursday morning to you all. Today I started my day with the expected
light roast, which I brewed in my Moka Express set on a gas burner on medium
heat (setting 5) and 2 and 2/3 Tbsp of coffee grounds. It took 3:17" for coffee
to start pouring out into the top chamber, and 3:28" for the brew to complete.

## Review

Sooner than expected, we've come down to a grounds volume that allows flavors
from the tap water to come through. It's not as noticeable as our infamous [2
Tbsp brew][day16], but I could tell from sip 1 that those notes were there.

I'll say now what I said then, which is, it's really not **bad**, it's just, I
want to be drinking something that's more sure of its identity; something
stronger. **6**/10. At one point I suspected that the sweet-spot for grounds
volume might be different for different roasts, but now I'm starting to think
that it's somewhere around 3.5 Tbsp.

## Thoughts for Tomorrow

I suppose I should test my suspicion that 3.5 Tbsp is our optimum, and make a
pot with that.
