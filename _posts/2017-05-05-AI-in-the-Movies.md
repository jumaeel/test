Hello and welcome to episode one of the Ethics in Computing
Podcast. I'm your host, Will Badart. Joining me in the studio today
are me, myself, and I. That's right, I'm as alone as humanity is in
the club of sentient automata. But how long will this last?

Today's discussion will focus on AI and its portrayal in Hollywood.

Science fiction movies like I, Robot seek to inspire awe at futures
could be, but also to speculate about the risks associated with
such technological might.

I, Robot features two primary AI characters, Sonny, a custom-built
NS-5 android, and the Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence (or,
"VIKI"), the disembodied super computer behind the US Robots and
Mechanical Men company.

The movie avoids taking an objective stance on the good of AI to
society (which many movies do by casting AI characters as strictly
good or strictly bad guys). Instead, the movie establishes an
interesting subversion: the truly "bad" AI is the one we feel more
inclined to trust at first: VIKI is much more similar to the AI
programs already in the world (a bodiless female voice that gives
us information when we ask for it). Meanwhile the AI who ends up
being "good" is the one we may be less inclined to trust at first:
Sonny and the other NS-5 robots undeniably occupy the uncanny
valley (the hypothesis that human replicas that appear almost, but
not exactly like real humans, invoke feelings of eeriness and
revulsion among observers). Not to mention, Sonny is basically
framed for murder early in the movie, which doesn't help his case.

Considering this movie was based on a book published in 1950 (which
itself was compiled from a series of short stories written by Isaac
Asimov in 1940), I think many aspects of the AI depicted were quite
plausible or even realistic. I think VIKI in particular represents
a very real possibility regarding the way AI will support companies
in the near future, providing support to building management,
finance, and even assisting (or heck, making) business decisions. I
don't think Sonny and the other NS-5s are too far over the horizon
either. The whole dreaming thing was a little bit out there, but
the concept of life-like androids becoming commercially available
as butlers seems like it could be very real.

In general, robots were integrated harmoniously with the movie's
society, and their presence was accepted by most everyone with just
a couple key exceptions (where it drove plot). To characterize
humanity's reception of robots and AI in this movie in a word, I'd
say "unconcerned" is pretty accurate (at least, until their eyes
turn red and try to kill everyone when a rogue AI misconstrues the
three laws to destroy humanity). On the flip side, robots in
general accepted their rung in the social ladder just under humans.
To quote an AI character in another of Asimov's works (the robot
surgeon in Bicentennial Man) "It is my pleasure to please you, sir.
If your orders were to interfere with my functioning with respect
to you or to any other human being, I would not obey you. The First
Law, concerning my duty to human safety, would take precedence over
the Second Law relating to obedience. Otherwise, obedience is my
pleasure." This line pretty well summarizes the attitude of almost
all the robots in I Robot. It's only Sonny, who has been programmed
not to consider the three laws, and VIKI, who thinks she's cracked
them, who do not seem to hold this attitude.

At the end of the day, I think I Robot paints an optimistic picture
of AI's future role in society. Simultaneously, it comments on human
nature (specifically, the atrocities perpetrated and accepted by its
members), and in a way, encourages us to do better. Overall, I give
this movie a thumbs up: it has great pacing, high action, and just
the right amount of philosophy for a Will Smith movie.
