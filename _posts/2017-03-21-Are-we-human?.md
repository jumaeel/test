Well, more like, "are *they* human?" This post will be an exploration of corporate personhood.

<!-- MORE -->

The way I see it, corporate personhood or "corporations as people" is the concept treating businesses as legally identical to living, breathing people. Legal corporations are a natural evolution of human organization; they allow for ownership of land, capital, etc. to extend beyond the lifetime of an individual, and for people to distribute liability amongst themselves to amortize risk. John Coffee, in July 28, 2014's [Morning Edition](http://npr.org/programs/morning-edition) suggested that the Catholic church may have been history's first corporation (in the modern sense of the word) as it was likely the first organization to buy land in its own name (which I thought was interesting).

So it seems that corporations are a natural part of life, but we obviously can't treat them **just like** people; people can go to jail, die, procreate (I suppose you could draw corporate parallels to all those things but if you genuinely believe that identical treatment for people and corporations would be legally functional, I'd love to hear your reasoning).

That's where I think corporate personhood is an issue of **balance** more than anything else.

## Take the power back!

Back in my high school days, I was pretty involved the [Junior Statesmen of America](http://jsa.org), a national student-led organization that fought against political apathy. My friends and I took our involvement seriously and, as I continue to do, treasured the integrity of our democracy. This was all pretty well timed with the Citizens United ruling, which was the hottest corporate personhood issue of its time (and probably my life).

Thusly my view of corporations as people was pretty set: the five justices ruling in favor of the Citizens United organization viewed companies as people and subsequently corrupted our democracy by allowing untold hundreds of millions of corporate dollars to flow into our elections. Everyone should have a fair say in the elections, but the Citizens United ruling gave super-rich corporations (and individuals) more of a voice than the rest of us.

This view of mine sat considerably far down one side of this issue's spectrum, and viewed the whole thing pretty narrowly. I maintain that election reform is badly needed and that corporations' sway in elections be legally balanced, but corporate personhood is not mutually exclusive with this view.

Down the other side of the spectrum is the idea that corporate personhood is enshrined in the Constitution and an age-old legal tradition. Since our nation's early history, the government was responsible for chartering corporations. Nonetheless, legal barriers between the private and public sectors date just as far back. This separation of government from business seems to a key facet of corporate personhood. Any freedom granted to a business is a power not granted to the government, which seems to be a generally democratic arrangement.

One trend I've noticed in this camp is that it can be decidedly "just desserts" when it comes to business, suggesting that businesses enjoy all the legal protections people do under the Constitution, without necessarily facing the same social responsibilities.

## The Middle Path

Kent Greenfield for The Atlantic proposes a view that seems to balance corporate power and responsibility all while optimizing for productivity and profit. Too good to be true? Possibly (but possibly not).

One suggestion I found particularly interesting was to implement systems of *codetermination*, wherein employees are directly represented on executive boards.

> With these management structures, corporations continue their focus on building wealth—that is the core purpose of the corporate form—but not for a narrow sliver of their investors only.
> -- Kent Greenfield, If Corporations are People, They Should Act Like It

This system, as Greenfield puts it, "[mimics] the traits of human personhood," by making corporations more pluralistic in their governance (after all, we as people wear many hats and have many motivations: if corporations are to be viewed as people, shouldn't the same apply?). This system evidently works in practice, as a former Siemens CEO embraced it as a "comparative advantage." Here's one more quote as food for thought:

> Only the rare oddball... behaves as if accumulating money is the paramount and unitary good.

Corporate personhood seems to being playing an important role in recent speculation about a federal *Muslim registry*. More than a handful of tech giants (including Facebook, after a little mishap with a misfired email) have spoken out against such a tool, pledging never to take part in its construction. In these cases, companies seem to being showing some sort of moral compass, though you could argue that they're just "selling social good" (see the latest season of South Park or the second season of Mr. Robot).

What's interesting is that, as Kaveh Waddel points out for The Atlantic, it's unlikely that many of the companies which have recently spoken out would ever be enlisted by the government to build the registry. While it may ask for travel data from Uber or social data from Facebook, Waddel suggests that the building of the tool would fall to a federal contractor like Deloitte or Booz Allen (the latter of which I would find interesting...).

If I were working on the BAH team charged with building the registry, I can't say for sure that I'd be able to stop or even identify it. If push comes to shove, and this thing is built, I **highly** doubt it'll come down to one team building a database and a little infrastructure. BAH is divided into six Functional Service Offerings (FSOs) two of which are Cybersecurity and Systems Engineering. If I had to guess, you'd see at least one team from each of those groups working on atomic components that are individually unidentifiable with any Muslim registry. And that's likely how the policy would be packaged too: "MUSLIM REGISTRY" (in all caps!) would be a tough pill for the public to swallow (as the current administration has already learned from the media backlash) so I foresee a series of more minute, seemingly independent policy changes which would culminate in a Muslim registry.

But that's all a big "What If?". As far as we can tell, there's no insidious conspiracy to bring this to fruition, so let's at least hope it stays that way.
