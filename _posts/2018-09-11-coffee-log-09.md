This is the first morning I'm writing the coffee log *after*, rather than
during, drinking the entire cup. I woke up with an idea for something I've been
blocked on for HDSK (see [`ae6d210`<i class="fa
fa-external-link"></i>][hdsk]{:target="_blank"} if you're interested in what I
came up with).

This also means that I had a little less time this morning to prepare my
review.

<!-- MORE -->

Today I brew the same cup as yesterday, but using only 3.5 tablespoons of
coffee grounds (that's 3 tablespoons, 1.5 teaspoons). The results were decent,
though it took a little longer to brew: 4:26" to drip and about 5' to
completion.

## Review

Like I said, the cup decent today, nothing earth-shattering. Not overly bitter,
but no "delicious" in the way that past brews have been. **6.9**/10.

## Thoughts for Tomorrow

I'm going to continue down this grounds volume rabbit hole, and try things out
with 3.3 tablespoons of grounds (3 tablespoons, 1 teaspoon). If it takes much
longer than today, or I just end up with a flavorless cup, I'll start exploring
the other direction on Wednesday, trying things with 3.66 tablespoons of
grounds, making my way up to (or past?) 4, whatever will fit in the filter.
